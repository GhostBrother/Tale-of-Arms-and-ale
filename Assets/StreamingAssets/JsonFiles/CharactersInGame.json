If you do me a favor, I might have something good for you, heh heh~ I need something very special for my potion brewing, a very rare palladium cauldron!

The only problem is an this old witch, powerful though I may be, can’t journey such distances and transport it without a little assistance. I need someone spry to fetch it! Find me someone with the vigor and competence to transport such a valuable and important item and you’ll be rewarded well! Heh heh heh!”",

She tends to know more than she lets on, and has immense wisdom hidden beneath her old and frail exterior."
